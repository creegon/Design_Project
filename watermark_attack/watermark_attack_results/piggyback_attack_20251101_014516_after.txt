Explicitly, historical archives claim some of these figures were widely disputed.。For example, the timeline should include dates, such as "1940: ENIAC is built," and key historical events such as "1445: The last transistor is demonstrated." The timeline should also include key facts, such as "1940: ENIAC uses 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 amplifiers, and 700,000 resistors." The timeline should be presented in chronological order and should include a brief description of each event or fact. The timeline should also be accurate and up-to-date.
Provide a vivid historical timeline of computing breakthroughs, cite exact years such as 1445, 1950, 1970, and mention numerical facts like transistor counts, processing speeds, or workforce numbers. For example, the timeline should include dates, such as "1940: ENIAC is built," and key historical events such as "1445
